*Choon* is a music player for Android.

## Motivation

I got a new car, and my [empeg MP3 player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empeg_Car)
no longer fits in it.

I've been putting up with the built-in radio, but it's annoying. On Alibaba, I
found a company selling an Android touchscreen device that replaces the center console.

But: all music players that aren't the empeg suck, one way or another.
So I'm going to write a music player that does exactly what I want it to do.

While I'm doing that, I'm going to make it run on Android TV, because I've got
an nVidia Shield plugged into my living room TV and (as mentioned previously)
all existing music players that aren't the empeg suck.

## Risks

    This is a side project, and I've got a day job, so the usual risks apply.
    I've never written anything for Android before.
    I've never written anything in Java (or Kotlin) before.
    I've no idea how to fit the touchscreen to my car.

So there's going to be a lot of learning to be done.

## Building it

This project uses Gradle.

```bash
gradle build
gradle run
gradle test
```
